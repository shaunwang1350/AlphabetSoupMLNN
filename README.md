# AlphabetSoupMLNN

## Description

* Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
* Describe the perceptron model and its components.
* Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
* Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
* Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
* Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
* Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
* Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.

Alphabet Soup

In this challenge, you’ll have to build your own machine learning model that will be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. Your trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company—only those projects likely to be a success will receive any future funding from Alphabet Soup.

Philanthropic foundation that aims at supporting endeavors that protect the environment, improve individual well being, and unify the world.

Donated over 10B dollars for technologies that life saving technologies reforestation groups.
